## Hi there 👋

My name is Aaron, and I'm a security-focused software engineer who strives every day to learn how to build secure systems.  
Most of my day-to-day work is **Java + Spring** backend development, building things that **can't fail**.

- 🔭 I’m currently working in the **payment card industry**, helping integrate industry security standards and cryptography operations.
- 🤔 Strong interest in problem solving, cryptography, and security-oriented software design.
- ☘️ As a side hobby, I’m currently learning Chinese 🇨🇳, so we can exchange some 汉字 if you want 😄.
